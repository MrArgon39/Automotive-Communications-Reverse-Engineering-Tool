# Automotive-Communications-Reverse-Engineering-Tool
A little tool that I am building to help me with my cluster projects.
This will help to find the communication codes to make them do the do.
This is intended to work with the Toyota/Lexus MPX system, using code from fiztech's BeanMPX project. https://github.com/fiztech-code/BeanMPX
It can also work with CANBUS and GMLAN, but those are not yet implemented.
